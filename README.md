My weekly review process consists of reviewing all of the files that I created this week, but I found opening all of those files in Obsidian to be a bit tedious. This plugin opens all of the files you have created in the last week (how many days you want to open is configurable).


## Usage

To use this plugin:
1. Open the command palette
2. Choose the command "Start Review"
3. Enjoy
